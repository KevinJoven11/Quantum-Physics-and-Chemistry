# Quantum-Physics-and-Chemistry

This repository is about some codes in quantum physics and quantum chemistry. The principal idea is to programing some well know problems or others that are (at the beginning) not challeging to programing.
 This repository include:
 
 ## 1. Normal variational theorem.
 
 This is a very well know problem. In which we have only one parameters to determined in our problem.
 
 ## 2. The uncertaintly principle.
