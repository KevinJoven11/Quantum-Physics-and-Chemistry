# Quantum-Physics-and-Chemistry

This repository is about some codes in quantum physics and quantum chemistry. The principal idea is to programing some well know problems or others that are (at the beginning) not challeging to programing.
 This repository include:
 
## 1. Normal Variational Theorem. ![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/COMPLETE-30%25-green)
 
This is a very well know problem. In which we have only one parameters to determined in our problem.  
![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/IMPROVEMENTS-1-ff69b4)
* Try to increased the number of parameters in the function a differents potentials.
 
## 2. The Uncertaintly Principle. ![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/COMPLETE-45%25-orange)

This is a basic program in which we try to find the variance in momentum and posicion in a particular function.  
![LaTeX](https://img.shields.io/badge/IMPROVEMENTS-1-ff69b4)
* Generalize the code for any function.
 
## 3. Pure and Mized States. 


 
## 4. Qiskit basic guide.
 
 
## 5. Quantum Game Theory.
